# HyperLink-YTracker
Chrome extension to track all hyperlinks on the visited pages

Developed a Chrome extension to monitor and log hyperlinks from visited web pages, including dynamically added content, storing data in local storage or IndexedDB. Created a detailed statistics popup and a detailed information page. Implemented native messaging to log hyperlink data into a persistent SQLite database using a Python application.
